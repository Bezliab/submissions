## 🧮 Pregnancy Tracking Logic

When a mother registers, she provides an **Expected Delivery Date (EDD)**.
The app automatically calculates:

- The **current pregnancy week**
- **Days remaining** to delivery
- The **trimester** (1st, 2nd, or 3rd)

This data is displayed dynamically on the **Dashboard** and updates daily.

## 🧩 Key Files

| File                     | Description                              |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| `firebaseService_rnf.js` | Handles Firestore read/write and caching |
| `Dashboard.js`           | Displays live pregnancy progress         |

## 🔄 Offline Mode

Firestore automatically caches user data locally.
This means users can continue using the app without an internet connection.
Once reconnected, updates sync automatically to Firebase.

---

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

✅ Create a new account using Firebase Authentication
✅ Enter EDD and verify correct pregnancy progress
✅ Add reminders and appointments
✅ Simulate offline use (disable internet, re-enable to test sync)
✅ Confirm Firestore data under the correct user document
